1436. Destination City
You are given the array paths, where paths[i] = [cityAi, cityBi] means there exists a direct path going from cityAi to cityBi. Return the destination city, that is, the city without any path outgoing to another city.

It is guaranteed that the graph of paths forms a line without any loop, therefore, there will be exactly one destination city.

Example 1:

Input: paths = [["London","New York"],["New York","Lima"],["Lima","Sao Paulo"]]
Output: "Sao Paulo"
Explanation: Starting at "London" city you will reach "Sao Paulo" city which is the destination city. Your trip consist of: "London" -> "New York" -> "Lima" -> "Sao Paulo".
Example 2:

Input: paths = [["B","C"],["D","B"],["C","A"]]
Output: "A"
Explanation: All possible trips are:
"D" -> "B" -> "C" -> "A".
"B" -> "C" -> "A".
"C" -> "A".
"A".
Clearly the destination city is "A".

class Solution:
    def destCity(self, paths: List[List[str]]) -> str:
        outgoing = {}
        for path in paths:
            city_a, city_b = path
            outgoing[city_a] = outgoing.get(city_a, 0) + 1
            outgoing[city_b] = outgoing.get(city_b, 0)

        for city in outgoing:
            if outgoing[city] == 0:
                return city

we are adding 1 to city_a which doesnt really matter because we only care about city_b
and then return the city with 0 since it only shows up once

1365. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number
Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].

Return the answer in an array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
Explanation:
For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3).

704. Binary Search
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-9999 <= nums[i], target <= 9999
All the integers in nums are unique.
nums is sorted in an ascending order.

class Solution:

            if val == target:
                return i
        return -1

 next solution uses binary search and is more efficient
 start = start index
 end = end index
 mid = divide by 2 , use floor //

if target num is greater than mid, use mid as new start, and opposite until
you find your target

class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        start = 0
        end = len(nums)-1

        while start < end:

1561. Maximum Number of Coins You Can Get
Medium

There are 3n piles of coins of varying size, you and your friends will take piles of coins as follows:

In each step, you will choose any 3 piles of coins (not necessarily consecutive).
Of your choice, Alice will pick the pile with the maximum number of coins.
You will pick the next pile with maximum number of coins.
Your friend Bob will pick the last pile.
Repeat until there are no more piles of coins.
Given an array of integers piles where piles[i] is the number of coins in the ith pile.

Return the maximum number of coins which you can have.

Example 1:

Input: piles = [2,4,1,2,7,8]
Output: 9
Explanation: Choose the triplet (2, 7, 8), Alice Pick the pile with 8 coins, you the pile with 7 coins and Bob the last one.
Choose the triplet (1, 2, 4), Alice Pick the pile with 4 coins, you the pile with 2 coins and Bob the last one.
The maximum number of coins which you can have are: 7 + 2 = 9.
On the other hand if we choose this arrangement (1, 2, 8), (2, 4, 7) you only get 2 + 4 = 6 coins which is not optimal.
Example 2:

Input: piles = [2,4,5]

1472. Design Browser History
You have a browser of one tab where you start on the homepage and you can visit another url, get back in the history number of steps or move forward in the history number of steps.

Implement the BrowserHistory class:

BrowserHistory(string homepage) Initializes the object with the homepage of the browser.
void visit(string url) Visits url from the current page. It clears up all the forward history.
string back(int steps) Move steps back in history. If you can only return x steps in the history and steps > x, you will return only x steps. Return the current url after moving back in history at most steps.
string forward(int steps) Move steps forward in history. If you can only forward x steps in the history and steps > x, you will forward only x steps. Return the current url after forwarding in history at most steps.


Example:

Input:
["BrowserHistory","visit","visit","visit","back","back","forward","visit","forward","back","back"]
[["leetcode.com"],["google.com"],["facebook.com"],["youtube.com"],[1],[1],[1],["linkedin.com"],[2],[2],[7]]

browserHistory.forward(2);                // You are in "linkedin.com", you cannot move forward any steps.
browserHistory.back(2);                   // You are in "linkedin.com", move back two steps to "facebook.com" then to "google.com". return "google.com"
browserHistory.back(7);                   // You are in "google.com", you can move back only one step to "leetcode.com". return "leetcode.com"

Constraints:

1 <= homepage.length <= 20

1. Two Sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(len(nums)):
                print('i', i, nums[i])
                print('j', j, nums[j])
                if i != j and nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    return [i, j]
i 0 3

j 1 2
i 0 3
j 2 4
i 1 2
j 0 3
i 1 2
j 1 2
i 1 2

This is a better optimized solution:

    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        d = {}
        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            m = target - n
            if m in d:

121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Easy
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 104

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:

153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
Prior to being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 5000
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
All values of nums are unique.
nums is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
-104 <= target <= 104

class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1
        
        while left < right:
            midpoint = (left + right) // 2
            
            if nums[midpoint] > nums[right]:
                left = midpoint + 1
            else:
                right = midpoint
        
        start = left
        left = 0    
        right = len(nums) - 1
        
        if target >= nums[start] and target <= nums[right]:
            left = start
        else:
            right = start
        
        while left <= right:
            midpoint = (left + right) // 2
            
            if nums[midpoint] == target:
                return midpoint
            elif nums[midpoint] > target:
                right = midpoint - 1
            else:
                left = midpoint + 1
                
        return -1

11. Container With Most Water   #   TWo pointer prob
Medium
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Notice that you may not slant the container.
Example 1:

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
Output: 16
Example 4:

Input: height = [1,2,1]
Output: 2
 
Constraints:
n == height.length
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= height[i] <= 104

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        max_area = 0
        left = 0
        right = len(height) - 1
        
        while left < right:
