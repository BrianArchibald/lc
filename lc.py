1436. Destination City
You are given the array paths, where paths[i] = [cityAi, cityBi] means there exists a direct path going from cityAi to cityBi. Return the destination city, that is, the city without any path outgoing to another city.

It is guaranteed that the graph of paths forms a line without any loop, therefore, there will be exactly one destination city.

Example 1:

Input: paths = [["London","New York"],["New York","Lima"],["Lima","Sao Paulo"]]
Output: "Sao Paulo"
Explanation: Starting at "London" city you will reach "Sao Paulo" city which is the destination city. Your trip consist of: "London" -> "New York" -> "Lima" -> "Sao Paulo".
Example 2:

Input: paths = [["B","C"],["D","B"],["C","A"]]
Output: "A"
Explanation: All possible trips are:
"D" -> "B" -> "C" -> "A".
"B" -> "C" -> "A".
"C" -> "A".
"A".
Clearly the destination city is "A".

class Solution:
    def destCity(self, paths: List[List[str]]) -> str:
        outgoing = {}
        for path in paths:
            city_a, city_b = path
            outgoing[city_a] = outgoing.get(city_a, 0) + 1
            outgoing[city_b] = outgoing.get(city_b, 0)

        for city in outgoing:
            if outgoing[city] == 0:
                return city

we are adding 1 to city_a which doesnt really matter because we only care about city_b
and then return the city with 0 since it only shows up once

1365. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number
Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].

Return the answer in an array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
Explanation:
For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3).

class Solution:
    def smallerNumbersThanCurrent(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        output = []
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            count = 0
            for j in range(len(nums)):

                print('nums[i]=', nums[i], 'nums[j]=', nums[j])
                if j != i and nums[j] < nums[i]:
                    count += 1
            output.append(count)
        return output

i= 0 j= 0
nums[i]= 8 nums[j]= 8
i= 0 j= 1
nums[i]= 8 nums[j]= 1
i= 0 j= 2
nums[i]= 8 nums[j]= 2

704. Binary Search
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-9999 <= nums[i], target <= 9999
All the integers in nums are unique.
nums is sorted in an ascending order.

class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        for i, val in enumerate(nums):
            if val == target:
                return i
        return -1

 next solution uses binary search and is more efficient
 start = start index
 end = end index
 mid = divide by 2 , use floor //

if target num is greater than mid, use mid as new start, and opposite until
you find your target

class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        N = len(nums)
        l, r = 0, N-1
        
        while l <= r:
            mid = (l+r) // 2
            if target == nums[mid]: return mid
            
            elif target > nums[mid]:
                l = mid + 1
            else:
                r = mid -1
        return -1

409. Longest Palindrome
Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with those letters.

Letters are case sensitive, for example, "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
Explanation:
One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
Example 2:

Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: s = "bb"
Output: 2

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 2000
s consists of lowercase and/or uppercase English letters only.

        result = 0
        is_odd = False
        for char in count:

                is_odd = True

        if is_odd:

1561. Maximum Number of Coins You Can Get
Medium

There are 3n piles of coins of varying size, you and your friends will take piles of coins as follows:

In each step, you will choose any 3 piles of coins (not necessarily consecutive).
Of your choice, Alice will pick the pile with the maximum number of coins.
You will pick the next pile with maximum number of coins.
Your friend Bob will pick the last pile.
Repeat until there are no more piles of coins.
Given an array of integers piles where piles[i] is the number of coins in the ith pile.

Return the maximum number of coins which you can have.

Example 1:

Input: piles = [2,4,1,2,7,8]
Output: 9
Explanation: Choose the triplet (2, 7, 8), Alice Pick the pile with 8 coins, you the pile with 7 coins and Bob the last one.
Choose the triplet (1, 2, 4), Alice Pick the pile with 4 coins, you the pile with 2 coins and Bob the last one.
The maximum number of coins which you can have are: 7 + 2 = 9.
On the other hand if we choose this arrangement (1, 2, 8), (2, 4, 7) you only get 2 + 4 = 6 coins which is not optimal.
Example 2:

Input: piles = [2,4,5]

1472. Design Browser History
You have a browser of one tab where you start on the homepage and you can visit another url, get back in the history number of steps or move forward in the history number of steps.

Implement the BrowserHistory class:

BrowserHistory(string homepage) Initializes the object with the homepage of the browser.
void visit(string url) Visits url from the current page. It clears up all the forward history.
string back(int steps) Move steps back in history. If you can only return x steps in the history and steps > x, you will return only x steps. Return the current url after moving back in history at most steps.
string forward(int steps) Move steps forward in history. If you can only forward x steps in the history and steps > x, you will forward only x steps. Return the current url after forwarding in history at most steps.


Example:

Input:
["BrowserHistory","visit","visit","visit","back","back","forward","visit","forward","back","back"]
[["leetcode.com"],["google.com"],["facebook.com"],["youtube.com"],[1],[1],[1],["linkedin.com"],[2],[2],[7]]
Output:
[null,null,null,null,"facebook.com","google.com","facebook.com",null,"linkedin.com","google.com","leetcode.com"]

Explanation:

browserHistory.visit("linkedin.com");     // You are in "facebook.com". Visit "linkedin.com"
browserHistory.forward(2);                // You are in "linkedin.com", you cannot move forward any steps.
browserHistory.back(2);                   // You are in "linkedin.com", move back two steps to "facebook.com" then to "google.com". return "google.com"
browserHistory.back(7);                   // You are in "google.com", you can move back only one step to "leetcode.com". return "leetcode.com"

Constraints:

1. Two Sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(len(nums)):
                print('i', i, nums[i])
                print('j', j, nums[j])
                if i != j and nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    return [i, j]
i 0 3
j 0 3
i 0 3
j 1 2
i 0 3
j 2 4
i 1 2
j 0 3
i 1 2
j 1 2
i 1 2
j 2 4

This is a better optimized solution:

    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        d = {}
        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            m = target - n
            if m in d:
                return [d[m], i]
            else:
                d[n] = i

# clearer
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):

       for i, value in enumerate(nums): #1
           remaining = target - nums[i] #2
           
           if remaining in seen: #3
               return [i, seen[remaining]]  #4

167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted

Given an array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
Return the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed) as an integer array answer of size 2, where 1 <= answer[0] < answer[1] <= numbers.length.
The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

 

Example 1:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        seen = {}
        for i, v in enumerate(numbers):
            remaining = target - numbers[i]
            if remaining in seen:
                return [seen[remaining] + 1, i + 1] 
            else:
                seen[v] = i 

###############################################################################################################
# len(nums)-2 is because we need at least 3 numbers to continue.
# if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1] is because when i = 0, it doesn't need to check if it's a duplicate element since it doesn't even have a previous element to compare with.
# And nums[i] == nums[i-1] is to prevent checking duplicate again.
# (This seems to be a good pattern which has been seen in other questions as well).

class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
       
        nums.sort()
        res = []

        for i in range(len(nums) -2): #1
            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]: #2

                continue #2
            self.dfs(candidates[i+1:], target - candidates[i], path+[candidates[i]], res) #3
The only differences are lines #1, 2, 3. The difference in problem statement in this one and combinations problem of my previous post is >>>candidates must be used once<<< and lines #1 and 2 are here to take care of this. Line #1 has two components where first i > 0 and second candidates[i] == candidates[i-1]. The second component candidates[i] == candidates[i-1] is to take care of duplicates in the candidates variable as was instructed in the problem statement. Basically, if the next number in candidates is the same as the previous one, it means that it has already been taken care of, so continue. The first component takes care of cases like an input candidates = [1] with target = 1 (try to remove this component and submit your solution. You'll see what I mean). The rest is similar to the previous post

121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Easy
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]

153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.

class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
Medium

!!!     Another Binary Search, we want to find the pivot point (or the smallest element, which would be the pivot), then figure out what side to use binary search on.

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
Prior to being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 5000
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
All values of nums are unique.
nums is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
-104 <= target <= 104

class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1
        
        while left < right:
            midpoint = (left + right) // 2
            
            if nums[midpoint] > nums[right]:
                left = midpoint + 1
            else:
                right = midpoint
        
        start = left
        left = 0    
        right = len(nums) - 1
        
        if target >= nums[start] and target <= nums[right]:
            left = start
        else:
            right = start
        
        while left <= right:
            midpoint = (left + right) // 2

            else:

1588. Sum of All Odd Length Subarrays
Easy
Given an array of positive integers arr, calculate the sum of all possible odd-length subarrays.
A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.
Return the sum of all odd-length subarrays of arr.
Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,4,2,5,3]
Output: 58
Explanation: The odd-length subarrays of arr and their sums are:
[1] = 1
[4] = 4
[2] = 2
[5] = 5
[3] = 3
[1,4,2] = 7
[4,2,5] = 11
[2,5,3] = 10
[1,4,2,5,3] = 15
If we add all these together we get 1 + 4 + 2 + 5 + 3 + 7 + 11 + 10 + 15 = 58
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are only 2 subarrays of odd length, [1] and [2]. Their sum is 3.
Example 3:

Input: arr = [10,11,12]
Output: 66
 
Constraints:
1 <= arr.length <= 100
1 <= arr[i] <= 1000

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
Example 2:

Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]
Example 3:

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Note:

Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer. -3.
 

Example 1:

Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
Example 2:

Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.
Example 3:

Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 31
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.

Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
Example 4:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: 1
Explanation: n = 1 since there is 1 number, so all numbers are in the range [0,1]. 1 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
 
Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 104

198. House Robber   # DP  
Medium
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 400

class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        if len(nums) < 3:
            return max(nums)
        
        dp = [0] * len(nums)
        dp[0] = nums[0]
        dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])
        
        for i in range(2, len(nums)):
            dp[i] = max(nums[i] + dp[i-2], dp[i-1])
            print('dp', dp)
            print(nums[i] + dp[i-2], dp[i-1])

213. House Robber II
Medium
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: 0
 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 1000

class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums: return 0

91. Decode Ways  # DP
Medium
A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:

'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"
To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, "11106" can be mapped into:

"AAJF" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
"KJF" with the grouping (11 10 6)
Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because "06" cannot be mapped into 'F' since "6" is different from "06".

Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

Example 1:

Input: s = "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
Example 2:

Input: s = "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: "226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
Example 3:

Input: s = "0"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no character that is mapped to a number starting with 0.
The only valid mappings with 0 are 'J' -> "10" and 'T' -> "20", neither of which start with 0.
Hence, there are no valid ways to decode this since all digits need to be mapped.
Example 4:

Input: s = "06"
Output: 0
Explanation: "06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero ("6" is different from "06").
 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100

s contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).


Problem Reduction: variation of n-th staircase with n = [1, 2] steps.

Approach: We generate a bottom up DP table.

The tricky part is handling the corner cases (e.g. s = "30").

Most elegant way to deal with those error/corner cases, is to allocate an extra space, dp[0].

Let dp[ i ] = the number of ways to parse the string s[1: i + 1]

For example:
s = "231"
index 0: extra base offset. dp[0] = 1
index 1: # of ways to parse "2" => dp[1] = 1
index 2: # of ways to parse "23" => "2" and "23", dp[2] = 2
index 3: # of ways to parse "231" => "2 3 1" and "23 1" => dp[3] = 2


    def numDecodings(self, s: str) -> int:
        if not s or s[0]=='0':
            return 0

        dp = [0 for x in range(len(s) + 1)] 

        # base case initialization
        dp[0:2] = [1,1]

        for i in range(2, len(s) + 1): 
            # One step jump
            if 0 < int(s[i-1:i]):    #(2)
                dp[i] = dp[i - 1]
            # Two step jump
            if 10 <= int(s[i-2:i]) <= 26: #(3)
                dp[i] += dp[i - 2]
                
        return dp[-1]

# DP
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
How many possible unique paths are there?


Example 1:


Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28
Example 2:

Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down
Example 3:

Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
Example 4:

Input: m = 3, n = 3

55. Jump Game
Medium
Given an array of non-negative integers nums, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
0 <= nums[i] <= 105


class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        max_jump, N, i = 0, len(nums) -1, 0
        
        while i <= max_jump and i < N:

57. Insert Interval
Medium
Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).

You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
Example 3:

Input: intervals = [], newInterval = [5,7]
Output: [[5,7]]
Example 4:
Input: intervals = [[1,5]], newInterval = [2,3]
Output: [[1,5]]
Example 5:

Input: intervals = [[1,5]], newInterval = [2,7]
Output: [[1,7]]

ex. ----  ---  -----  -----
     ----
     so  we append the first interval with our end of the new one inserting bc they overlap

class Solution:
    def insert(self, intervals: List[List[int]], newInterval: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        i = 0
        while( i<len(intervals) and intervals[i][0] < newInterval[0]):
            i+= 1
        
        intervals.insert(i,newInterval)
        
        ans = []
        for interval in ::
            if len(ans) == 0 or ans[-1][1] < interval[0]:
                ans.append(interval)
            else:
                ans[-1][1] = max(ans[-1][1], interval[1])

696. Count Binary Substrings
Easy

Give a binary string s, return the number of non-empty substrings that have the same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings are grouped consecutively.
Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.

Example 1:

Input: s = "00110011"
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".
Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.
Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.
Example 2:

Input: s = "10101"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.

#  just need to keep track of how many 0's previously and 1's right now
def countBinarySubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
    ans, prev, cur = 0, 0, 1
    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            ans += min(prev, cur)
            prev = cur
            cur = 1
        else:
            cur += 1
    ans += min(prev, cur)
